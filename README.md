Arting In 112

I created Arting in 112 which is a simple paint program that gives the user the ability to draw lines by the pixels only within the canvas, eraser those lines, and be able to choose which colors they want.

The libraries used were: cmu_graphics and PIL

Instructions on program:

- Press/Hold '+' to make brush/eraser bigger
- Press/Hold '-' to make brush/eraser smaller
- Press 'e' to use eraser", 1245, 270, size = 14)

- Press 'g' to change color to green
- Press 'b' to change color to blue
- Press 'p' to change color to pink
